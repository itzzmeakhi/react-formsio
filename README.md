# react-formsio

Easy to use, super light form validation library for React.


-----

## Background

Before jumping to React, I was an Angular Developer. During the initial days
of learning React, I was like 'Oh! I am kind of missing Angular's kind of
built in validation in React', and the result was this library.


## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-formsio
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import MyComponent from 'react-formsio'
import 'react-formsio/dist/index.css'

class Example extends Component {
  render() {
    return <MyComponent />
  }
}
```
